Kayla White
"About"
My name is Kayla! It means "pure" according to 'TheBump.com'- a baby name database haha. I enjoy being outside, reading, and engaging in invigorating conversation with like-minded individuals. I dont debate, I just enjoy being in an echo-chamber lol. I love humanity and the environment, a big interesection for me as I learn how to code and bring together my vision for the future is environmental justice. As tech advances, so many people are left behind in an archaic world fighting just to have access to running water while I on the other side of money, can send funny philosphy memes to my friends at the tapping of a screen. Its an odd existence. That's a little about my brain and my spirit.(p)
